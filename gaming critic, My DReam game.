i take in the stand still approach of star conflict and dream of a whole new level, extra standstill motions of creation, i take in eve online and how thier space bases or stations have next tyo no station entry sequence but yet a right click dock feature to enter it, there is safety within the station but i see this as a bit lame. i think a station should have 8-20 open entry points with say a green or blue shield that a player can enter and dock, id like to see a rail network whereby your ship on entry and landing revolvs on a convey belt and a multiple landing ie: i take in the concept of another space sandbox called Elite dangerous docking and entering a rail network with your ship entering the starbase as a good value however the galaxy in it is way to big! it would be good to see several platform space games all merge all gaming concepts in a artistic way to merge thier individual galaxys together! i like the idea of dlc's including new ships etc, i have a value towards loot as in multiple ways to gain it either with $ or as known as grinding, my 3rd commandment of gaming: a game that gives a months satisfaction or free to play should invest 20usd towards game development and a player that has not purchased packages or dl's should recieve a approx of 30% of all content but a subscribed paying player or a player that spends on dls should recieve a 60% ish of game content, i take in the wow 85 cap world of warcraft pvp zones ; wintergrasp a door to earning great looking gear that has a great pvp advantage, battle zones which give a great value of pvp gears aaaaaaaaaalso and 3vs3 pvp giving the 3rd great looking pvp set with the greatest pvp gears with the greatest pvp mechanics built into armors; transmute these ideas into a space fighter. i take in Everspace another great title though small in content has a few great ships and awsome space fighter experiance to take that concept and throw in the best artistic forms, when i think of the loot code in wow being white, grey, green, blue ,purple, and orange being the highest quality! these loot colour coding have speread into many games albion etc etc etc a colour code and great equipping functions, taking in several artistic concepts and merging them into a choich of the way that the game layout will look for each player being different, game changes to be seated in a choice of a number of artistic layouts all open to player choice and game layout's in choice. i look at the captivating inventory that world of warcraft originally showed us in their franchise at cap 60 how different and fun it was to build a charters powers thru items or loot to not be dismissed in a space fighter/sci fi game! a ship in deapth inventory as well top proceed with similar values, sertain powers like psychic powers or a tier of perks '' Everspace used the in game credits to boost these values of ships etc thats great- also i concept sertain perks or powers increasing on such things a s kills, i look at robocraft having free of choice creative building and ''terror tech'' as much as some of these games are aimed for a sertain audiance i love the free choice of craetivity! ming in eve online was very fun in the begging but a lack of new mining vessels is anoying, eves gas mining with black holes was great in a c3 we possessed its functions and was very profitable and fun, i like game lock outs that help players with simple warnings alaaaaarms and calenders and calculaters all great! swtor star wars the old republic had a great concept in the beginning palming of old loot to companions to aid in your assault on sith or jedi and choosing which companions to trust with the best loot, i think a right hand char and a left hand char great! charter cards displaying character and comapnion abilitys and sats are fine, sending companions on resource hunts as a motion of just sitting back and letting them do the work is great, it enables a player to relax clean or do important things. 2nd concept of that i take the stage to x4 foundations whereby you can do missions gain resourses buy more ships and hire beings to go and simply asteroid mine by them selves with military escorts, with dozens of ships all working uncontrolled by the player i see as a great concept, and the thought of game hacks to manipulate a game to grind and complete content without a player effort but rather a system or programme that works to concept that in a game is a much wished for glory if done right! paying the kids pocket money to play your accounts some parents do it! x4 foundations congratulations on taking it to that new level! i wish for all this article to improve games but also direct me and my memory into my own unique game, its name unknown and most of my concepts remain unknown untill the day of release! i am a game critic and i take my allias name as andoe pires, in most games i play i choose that name, taking u back a bit to mass affect random loot like ammo explosive tip was added as loot and later scraped for bioware to make it easyier in 2 3 4 for kids, but my concept is switch your account with a lock out for your kids to play! a g+ version a m15+ version and a r rated version all concepted in the same game! r rated for gambling which mass affect did take to a new level many years ago in the first, id love to see a fair gamling decent game unlike pokie machines fit for the elderly to spend thier life savings as its been around for all them years id like to see a more fun gambling concept with art and my own concept: '' a smart gaming gambling licence where two p[layers pit against each other for big loot in not a winner takes all but the winner takes 63% and the loser takes 37% making it a fair fight or gamble on a gambling platform within a game! i like the forgive me that i cannot think of the title: i will update at some time, in its game to own real estate or land and find a sutible partner in game and bare ofspring was great in a medieval form place that into a scifi or like swtor making a legacy last name for players to merge seperate accounts in relationships etc would be great! my last mention's alex the kid in miracle world on sega master system was my first concole and first game wc1 ''warcraft 1 on a 386 megabyte harddrive pc! great balders gate dark alliance 2 on playstation slim form more of forgotten realms games + others command and conquer original on 386 bought as a demo or you actually payed 15$ for the full version and full gaming content of it! doom and wolfenstien original! all these and more were my great love growing up and baldersgate dark alliance 2 was great for loot!
